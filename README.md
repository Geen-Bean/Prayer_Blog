# Prayer Blog
My own personal faith blog/diary using HTML, CSS and PHP. I work better typing, but I love decorating my journals. This blog was my personal solution. The prayer journal consists of a Homepage, a Regen page, a Study page and a Prayer page. Because I don't want my personal information out on full display, some pages have changed significantly. 

There is currently a bug I have yet to fix and it is that the apostrophes are not escaping and creating a fatal error in MySQL. For now when creating or updating entries, I use 2 apostrophes. Currently trying to figure out mysqli_real_escape_string() to solve the issue. I'm struggling to download my database template, that may or may not make it on here. The responsiveness of the site in CSS also needs touch ups.

The **Homepage** has an introduction and an indepth explanation of design choices that I made.

The **Regen page** is taken from a 12-step program called Re:generation, created by Watermark church. I do not own any of the intellectual information on that page or on the pages linked to it. I have created these pages for my own personal use so that I can continue making entries based on the program's workbooks and to show my front end development skills. I do not intend to sell or take credit for this information. I have paid for and completed the program, and if you want to use this information you should too. **DO NOT USE. IF YOU WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROGRAM VISIT https://www.regenerationrecovery.org/** 

The **Study page** will store all of the topics that I want to explore/remember in my spiritual journey; sermons from main service, study group materials, any research I do in regards to race and gender, any discoveries I make to love others better through reconciliation and any resources I find for me to grow as a Christian. Previous entries are visible and can be edited and deleted on their base pages; Sermons, Study Group, Race, Gender, Reconciliation and How to Christian.

The **Prayer page** is for me to keep track of who I pray for and how often, allowing me to examine my heart and adjust accordingly. I also personally like that it will act as a time capsule and I can remember what I was grateful for back then or how my life has changed since I gave my worries/emotions to God. Keeping the one for others is a bit weird I think, but I kept it in for consistnecy.


# Credits/Resources
**Code**

The PHP/MYSQL code and database were created following a tutorial created by Packetcode on YouTube.

The HTML and CSS I did on my own after taking Internet Studio I and II from the University of Texas at Dallas. I referenced the textbooks _HTML & CSS, design and build websites_ and _JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY, interactive front-end web development_ both by Jon Duckett.

**Software**

I used PHPMyAdmin to create and store my database and XAMPP as my server. I also use Notepad++ like a weirdo haha.

Any material on the pages Regen, Inventory, Repentance Plans, Amends Plans, Reconciliation Plans, Workbooks and Additional Resources are not my intellectual property. This information was provided to me at cost by Watermark church. I do not consent for this information to be used for personal use. I posted this on github to show the scope of my work, not for others to actually use my personal diary as a template for their own. **Legal consequences can follow for both you and I, SO JUST DON'T.**

I created all of the graphics and design of the website, and hold sole ownership of the art. Do not take any of the graphics for commercial use.
