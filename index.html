					<h3>Introduction: 3/27/2022</br></h3>
					<p><strong>Hello. </strong>This is a cleaned up version of my prayer blog. I don't keep any particularly
						sensitive information on github, I just want to show off my front end development skills. The only thing 
						might be the Re:generation materials. PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE REGEN/REGENERATION MATERIALS. The 
						program needs the money to thrive and help others; a lot of the heavy lifting is done simply by being 
						in a group and forming a community with one another. I highly encourage that if you are curious of the 
						program and/or would like to use the materials, visit https://www.regenerationrecovery.org/</p>

					<h3>Design Notes:</br></h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Tiger Lily. </strong>
								I really like lilies in general. Honestly, they're a family favorite. We give lilies to each other on special occasions.
								 I also 
								really like tigers. The animal has cultural significance for me, and not because they're my chinese zodiac animal. 
								This will make sense if you know me (I'm Korean). I admire the fiery spirit and playful nature they are associated with. I also really loved 
								Tigger from Winnie the Pooh also. So it kind of makes sense. I don't particularly like how much the petals curl compared 
								to other lilies, but I love the spots and color on them. </br>
								The tiger lily also has special connotations that I wanted to convey in this personal work of mine. They are indigenous Korea,
								and can convey the ideas of wealth and prosperity as well as friendship. There is a story that a hermit crab found a tiger
								impaled by an arrow, and tried to save them. The tiger promised that their friendship would survive death, and upon dying 
								the tiger's body became a tiger lily. Kinda wild to be honest. The wealth part is because the spots kind of look like coins.</br>
								Victorian interpretations also convey dignified confidence, one that is not to be confused with arrogance and vanity. I hope
								to gain that sense of confidence and self-awareness. They are also said to protect from harm. While whatever may come will not 
								stop coming because of a flower, I still appreciate the symbolism. This website is to heal from harm, and to prevent further harm
								through studies and self-reflection. </br>
								Apparently it also means, "I dare you to love me", or "please love me". I wonder who "me" is in the context of my website. Is it God, 
								other people, myself, the world? All of the above? Since it's a personal project, it may be best suited for myself, but that implies I'm 
								not as well thought out design wise as I usually am haha.
						</br></br>
							<strong>Colors. </strong>
								Cream: #fbf7ee. Orange: #ff8254. Dark Orange: #961001. Sage: #cbd9cf. Light Green: #608b6a. Green: #075b46.</br>
								Maybe I've grown attached to the orange green combo of my alma mater. I've always 
								been drawn to visually loud stuff. Bright stuff. High contrast stuff. Complimentary colors. But I have to tone it down to 
								create a look that has greater mass appeal. So I tone down a little on the color wheel and choose a more dark tone for one 
								of the main colors, in this case green. I honestly really like the color green. It is a very balanced color, that gives off peace and stability. 
								The color calms me a lot and makes me optimistic in a soothing way. Orange helps bring life to the party. 
						</br></br>
							<strong>Fonts. </strong>
								Windsong, Cutive Mono, and Nunito Sans. I really wanted a whimsical yet scripted font for the title. It is a Christian blog 
								after all. I added a gradient on it to add some flair and define the letters better. The text with just one color looked really weird... 
								I really like type-writter-esque fonts, and usually choose them as my headers. I'm an old soul. Kind of. I'm more like a rock but it's okay.
								The last one I just need a simple san-serif font to just bring everything together. I typically go for wide lettering with thin lines like Raleway 
								or Montesserat, but I wanted the journal to look more dense. I had really wanted Futura PT, but alas, it isn't free. Nunito is a good substitution 
								though.
						</br></br>
							<strong>Buttons. </strong>
								I reused the tiger lily motif, and the background motif for all of the buttons. They are either leaves, petals, or the innocent rustic 
								background. There's a tint overlay when hovering and all have orange font. It was so difficult to pick a font color. The colors I had picked 
								were either too close in value, or too contrasting in hue. Those problems have plagued me every step of the design process. The journal entries 
								or the result. Thankfully boldening the text did the trick. God bless. I do really love the buttons though. I'm so proud of myself.
						</br></br>
							<strong>Code. </strong>
								Huge thank you to packetcode on YouTube. I followed their tutorial on how to create, edit, and delete blog posts. You can find the code they 
								create from the tutorial <a href="https://github.com/packetcode/blog-using-php-mysql">here.</a>
