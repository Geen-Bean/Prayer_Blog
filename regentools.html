						God with all your heart, with your soul and all your mind. 
						This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like 
						it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two 
						commandments depends all the law and the Prophets.'"</em> Matthew 22:37-40</p>
						</dd>
						<dt><h3>The Great Commission</h3></dt>
						<dd><p><em>"And Jesus came and said to [the disciples], 'All authority in 
						Heaven and on Earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples 
						of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and 
						of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. 
						And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"</em> Matthew 28:18-20</p>

						thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 
						Give us this day, our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses 
						as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into 
						temptation but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and 
						the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.</em> Matthew 6:9-13</p>

						<dt><h3>Forgiveness Truths</h3></dt>
						<dd><p>Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> excusing sin.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> freeing the guilty of a demand for justice.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> denying your hurt or stuffing your anger.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> a feeling and is not conditional.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> forgetting.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> trust.</br></br>
						Forgiveness is <strong>not</strong> reconciliation.</br></br>
						You don't need to forgive God.</br></br>
						You can't "forgive yourself."</br></br></p>

						<strong>Forgiveness Prayer</strong></br></br>
						Dear God, I am <u>F</u>acing the truth of how I have been hurt by [offense]. I 
						know you are intimately aware of my suffering and care about my pain. Please
						heal me; I am <u>R</u>eleasing my wounds to you. I know that your judgements are perfect 
						and that you desire for everyone to repent of sin and receive forgiveness through Christ, 
						just as I received your gift of forgiveness. So, I choose to forgive [name]. I <u>E</u>ntrust 
						my claims for justice to you. I surrender my rights for apologies, paybacks, bitterness
						or using this sin to my advantage. These debts are now yours to repay. Your justice and 
						vengeance for sin are perfect. I accept them as my own. Jesus, I praise and <u>E</u>xalt you 
						for paying my debts and becoming a peace offering to the world- even to those who have 
						hurt me! Help me love [name] with your love by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit 
						who lives in me. Amen.
